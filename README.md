## Roll

Aim for a submission and then move towards it; do not roll without a submission in mind.

Align my head and spine to be strengthen every posture.

Always be improving the angle.

## Practice

Prioritize submissions with good statistics and (if unsuccessful) good end positions.

Learn new moves, but practice only the ones here.

Practice with the dominant and the other sides with 8:2 ratio.

Exaggerate while practicing.

## Attack

### Feet vs Feet

Push with my head.

Continuously put weight and harass the opponent's head to break the posture: widen my palm, grab the back of the opponent's head, and curl my arm.

Penetrate with every move.
